Here you can find animations inspired by the ***CYBERPUNK 2077*** video game.<BR><BR>
There is 2 different sets of anims : CP77's [Corporations logos](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/tree/main/Animations/CP77#cyberpunk-2077-corporations) & [Motors Companies logos](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/tree/main/Animations/CP77#cyberpunk-2077-motors-companies), both having their anims all made on the same concept and *storyboard*. Anims of each set use identical meta.txt with exact same duration, and set to switch to next one every 10 mn. They all have passive + active frames. (Active : simply display logo + name a few seconds without the initial animation)
<BR><BR>
I also added a [manifest.txt](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/CP77/manifest.txt) file with all entries (both sets) for a quick copy&paste. (butthurt & level set for RogueMaster / Momentum FW, edit these if under another firmware or according to your own custom needs)

You can download each anim as [separate zip files](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/tree/main/Animations/CP77/Animation_ZIP_files%20(CP77)) or all together : [Corpo pack](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/CP77/Kuronons_CP77_Collection%20(12%20animations).zip) & [Motor pack](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/CP77/Kuronons_CP77MC_Collection%20(15%20animations).zip)

Also you can download those directly as an animation asset pack [Corpo A.P.](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/CP77/Kuronons%20-%20CP77%20(Asset%20pack).zip) & [Motor A.P.](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/CP77/Kuronons%20-%20CP77MC%20(Asset%20pack).zip) to use with Momentum firmware.
