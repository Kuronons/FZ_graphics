Here you can find animations inspired by the ***CYBERPUNK 2077*** video game.<BR>
The Arasaka, Militech, Kang Tao & Delamain animations are all made on the same concept and *storyboard*.<BR>
They use identical meta.txt with exact same duration, and set to switch to next one every 10 mn.<BR>
They all have passive + active frames. (Active : simply display logo + name a few seconds without the initial animation)

I also added a [manifest.txt](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/CP77/manifest.txt) file with all entries for a quick copy&paste. (butthurt & level set for RogueMaster / Momentum FW, edit these if under another firmware or according to your own custom needs)

You can download each anim as [separate zip files](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/tree/main/Animations/CP77/Animation_ZIP_files%20(CP77)) or [all together](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/CP77/Kuronons_CP77_Collection%20(4%20animations).zip).

Also you can download those directly as an [animation pack](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/CP77/Kuronons%20-%20CP77%20(Asset%20pack).zip) to use with Momentum / Xtreme firmwares.
