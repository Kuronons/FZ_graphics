   - ___LAUGHING MAN___   [v.2]

   - ___FLIPPAVERSE___
      
      Simple animation inspired by the pixel-art point&click cyberpunk game VirtuaVerse.
      
      Note : The passive frames are displaying nicely on the Flipper but active ones are a bit jerky due to the screen's refresh rate... :/

   - ___AKIRA CAPSULE___
      
      Capsule inspired by Kaneda's jacket logo in AKIRA. Pushing back will make the capsule stop moving and will display the scrolling text "Good for Health - Bad for Education".
      
      Note : Actual preview is kinda slow but the FPS (3) is set to avoid flickering on Flip's screen.
