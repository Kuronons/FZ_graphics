### FLIPPAVERSE
Simple animation inspired by the pixel-art point&click cyberpunk game *VirtuaVerse*.

Note : The passive frames are displaying nicely on the Flipper but active ones are a bit jerky due to the screen's refresh rate... :/<BR>

### AKIRA CAPSULE
Capsule inspired by Kaneda's jacket logo in *AKIRA*. Pushing back will make the capsule stop moving and will display the scrolling text "Good for Health - Bad for Education".

Note : Actual preview is kinda slow but the FPS (3) is set to avoid flickering on Flip's screen.<BR>

### HAL9000
Inspired by HAL9000 A.I. computer from 2001 - *A space Odyssey*, 1968 movie by Stanley Kubrick. Pushing back will display lines of dialogs.

Note : There is 2 different and randomized quotes from HAL. One is a talk with Dave, second is a talk with Frank.<BR>

### COWSAY
Fom [*Cowsay*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) ASCII generating image/text program.

Note : This animation uses ***bubbles*** and displays a random line out of 10 recorded.<BR>

### ZONE 414
Inspired by ***Zone 414***, 2021 anticipation movie by Andrew Baird.

Note : Inspiration came from the logo of the ***Veidt Corporation*** that can briefly be seen on a building at the beginning of the movie<BR>
Main difficulty was to flatten the design as the only visual of the logo is during a brief scene and it is seen from a perspective camera angle.<BR>
I also added the ***Zone 414*** logo as passive frames sequence.<BR>
