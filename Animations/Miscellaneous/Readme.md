Here you can find various animations I made for the Flipper Zero (.webm files are preview videos) :


   EYE OF THE FLIPPER
   
      My first FZ anim ! Inspired by the beginning of EYE OF THE BEHOLDER (1991 video game)
      Note : Only for EOB nerds... XD
   
   EARTH ARCADIA
      
      Passive frame are rotating Earth. Pushing BACK will make the Arcadia (anime Captain Harlock's ship) appears.
      
   JOLLY ROGER
   
      A unique frame animation of Rackham's Jolly Roger. Static background image.
      Note : Test for displaying a simple picture instead of animation
   
   LAUGHING MAN
      
      Inspired by the Warai Otoko (Laughing man) logo from the GHOST IN THE SHELL - STAND ALONE COMPLEX anime series.
      Note : Forgot to add the cap pin on logo... mistake hidden by status bar... XD 
   
   L
      
      "L" logo from DEATHNOTE anime. Pushing back will make a bunch of apples raining...
      Note : Not really happy with the apples falling... latency... :/
   
   RMCFW
      
      RogueMaster Custom Firmware animation with SD Goku.


Use the manifest.txt file for quick copy&paste. (butthurt & level set for RogueMaster FW, edit these if under another firmware)
