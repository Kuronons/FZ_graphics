Here are the animations I made for Flipper Zero. Folder-sorted by theme.

Each .zip file contains a folder including the animation frames under .bm files and the corresponding meta.txt one.

Animations previews via the readme files.

To install on your Flipper Zero :

1. unzip and drag&drop the folder into your flipper's SD card /dolphin/ folder
    
2. edit your manifest (SD/dolphin/manifext.txt) and add an entry as example below :

          Filetype: Flipper Animation Manifest
          Version: 1

          Name: Kuronons_SFlogo_Tyrell_128x64
          Min butthurt: 0
          Max butthurt: 14
          Min level: 1
          Max level: 30
          Weight: 5
    
3. Reboot your Flipper (OS) when done.
