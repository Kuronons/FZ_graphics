Here are the animations I made for Flipper Zero. Folder-sorted by theme.

Each .zip file contains a folder including the animation frames under .bm files and the corresponding meta.txt one.

Animations previews via the readme files.

To install on your Flipper Zero :

1. unzip and drag&drop the folder into your flipper's SD card /dolphin/ folder
    
2. edit your manifest (SD/dolphin/manifext.txt) and add an entry as example below :

          Filetype: Flipper Animation Manifest
          Version: 1

          Name: Kuronons_SFlogo_Tyrell_128x64
          Min butthurt: 0
          Max butthurt: 14
          Min level: 1
          Max level: 3
          Weight: 5
    
3. Reboot your Flipper (OS) when done.  

For better understanding on how animations work or how to make / set them, have a look of the [Flipper Zero Animation Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR_nZRakD6iwJVQS8Pf4y7Wm4klcucrC7EKVO8m_DQV63To7e-alqD0yaoO3sTygjcChfcRo80Hdeet/pub) summarized by ___Talking-Sasquach___.

You can also check [THE MOST COMMON MISTAKES DONE WHEN MAKING AN ANIMATION](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/Common_mistakes.md) I wrote if you're facing some issue making your animation. I'd say, as feedback proved, that there is 99% of chance your issue's origin is listed there... so take your time to check each point !
