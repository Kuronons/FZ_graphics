Here is a set of 30 "Jolly rogers" animations. Each animation starts with the same passive frames (a sailing pirate ship seen through a spyglass).

Pushing BACK BUTTON will make the spyglass zoom on the ship's flag.

Each animation has a different Jolly Roger with its own lines of chitchat and summary info of the black flag's corresponding captain.

Each animation is set to play 10 mn before randomly switching to the next one. It has been calibrating so the switch should be seamless... 

Note that this has been realized with a lot of research concerning the flags and their owners. Truth is most of the flags are recent designs inspired by some description from existing books, letters or reports. Reliability of these is, for the main part, very poor as well as the real stories of the known pirates. (most of their doing being in fact the creation of sensationalists)

This collection contains the following pirates flags :
Jeahan II Ango, Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, Renato Beluche, Stede Bonnet, Jean Boze, Eustache Busket, Edward Congdon, Jacquotte Delahaye, Michel de Maristéguy, Pierre Egron, Henry Every, Walter Kennedy, Jean Lafitte, Jean-François Landolphe, Pierre Lelong, Edward Lowe, Christopher Moody, William Moody, Napping, John Quelch, John Rackham, John Roberts, Edward Seegar, Robert Charles Surcouf, Edward Teach, Thomas Tew, richard Worley, Emmanuel Wynne & Frédéric Youx.

Here is a preview video with 2 displayed flags for an insight.

I also added a manifest.txt file with the 30 entries for a quick copy&paste. (butthurt & level set for RogueMaster FW, edit these if under another firmware)
