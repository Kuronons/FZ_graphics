Here you can find animations inspired by the ***CITIZEN SLEEPER*** games franchise.<BR>
All anims of this set has the exactly same meta and number of frames.<BR>
They all have the dice rolling as passive frames. Pushing back will make the DATA logo appears.

I also added a [manifest.txt](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/Citizen_Sleeper/manifest.txt) file with all entries for a quick copy&paste. (butthurt & level set for RogueMaster / Momentum FW, edit these if under another firmware or according to your own custom needs)

You can download each anim as [separate zip files](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/tree/main/Animations/Citizen_Sleeper/Animation_ZIP_files%20(Citizen_Sleeper)) or [all together](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/Citizen_Sleeper/Kuronons_Citizen_Sleeper_Collection%20(6%20animations).zip).

Also you can download those directly as an [animation pack](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/Citizen_Sleeper/Kuronons%20-%20Citizen%20Sleeper.zip) to use with Momentum.
