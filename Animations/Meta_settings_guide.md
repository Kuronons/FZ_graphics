</details><details><summary>üîπ Animation dimensions settings</summary>
  
- `Width` - animation width in px (<= 128)
- `Height` - animation height in px (<= 64)
</details><details><summary>üîπ Frames ordering</summary>

- `Passive frames` - number of bitmap frames for passive animation state
- `Active frames` - number of bitmap frames for active animation state (can be 0)
- `Frames order` - order of bitmap frames where first N frames are passive and following M are active. Each X number in order refers to bitmap frame, with name frame\_X.bm. This file must exist. Any X number can be repeated to refer same frame in animation.
</details><details><summary>üîπ Animation settings</summary>
  
- `Active cycles` - cycles to repeat of N active frames for full active period. E.g. if frames for active cycles are 6 and 7, and active cycles is 3, so full active period plays 6 7 6 7 6 7. Full period of passive + active period are called *total period*.
- `Frame rate` - number of frames to play for 1 second.
- `Duration` - total amount of seconds to play 1 animation.
- `Active cooldown` - amount of seconds (after passive mode) to pass before entering next active mode.
</details><details><summary>üîπ Bubbles settings</summary>
  
- `Bubble slots` - amount of bubble sequences.
- Any bubble sequence plays whole sequence during active mode. There can be many bubble sequences and bubbles inside it. Bubbles in 1 bubble sequence have to reside in 1 slot. Bubbles order in 1 bubble sequence is determined by occurrence in file. As soon as frame index goes out of EndFrame index of bubble - next animation bubble is chosen. There can also be free of bubbles frames between 2 bubbles.

- `Slot` - number to unite bubbles for same sequence.
- `X`, `Y` - are coordinates of left top corner of bubble.
- `Text` - text in bubble. New line is `\n`
- `AlignH` - horizontal place of bubble corner (Left, Center, Right)
- `AlignV` - vertical place of bubble corner (Top, Center, Bottom)
- `StartFrame`, `EndFrame` - frame index range inside whole period to show bubble.

### Understanding of frame indexes

For example we have

```
Passive frames: 6
Active frames: 2
Frames order: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Active cycles: 4
```

Then we have indexes

```
                        passive(6)            active (2 * 4)
Real frames order:   0  1  2  3  4  5     6  7  6  7  6  7  6  7
Frames indexes:      0  1  2  3  4  5     6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13
```

### üî∏  Bubbles : Definition
Bubbles are text inputs that will display as an additional layer above an animation, enclosed in coded-drawn lines in the spirit of comic book speech bubble.<BR><BR>

### üî∏  Bubble placement
Bubble placement on screen is defined by its upper-left corner's coordinates.<BR>
Screen is  128x64px. First column (X - from left) as well as first line (Y - from top) are designed by **0**.
Coordinates will be set as :
- `X: ` = horizontal coordinate (values range = `0` to `127`)
- `Y: ` = vertical coordinate (values range = `0` to `63`)

![BP0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d25a2ae-4f55-434f-a954-87842172030b)

> [!TIP]
> The placement being only defined by the upper-left corner of the bubble, it must be thought in regards of those 3 factors :<BR>
> ‚Æö Lenght of the longest text line for the X value<BR>
> ‚Æö Number of text lines for the Y one<BR>
> ‚Æö Postion of the [bubble's tail](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/Meta_settings_guide.md#--bubbles-tail-positioning)<BR>

> [!WARNING]
> A **negative value in X or Y** will result of a ***furi_hal error*** and would most likely put your Flipper in an **endless restart-loop !!**<BR>
> If it happens, just get the SD out and fix the meta by entering a positive value.<BR>
> If you don't have an SD card reader, take the SD card out and re-insert it again without passing the SD welcome splash-screen.<BR>
> It will allow you to overwrite the non-functioning meta via qFlipper files management.
<BR>

### üî∏  Bubble text line
The displayed text of the bubble is defined by the eponymous function :
- `Text: ` followed by the text to display. Note that the part of the text lenght that would be out of the screen will not be visible anyhow.

![ABCD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f21a19d-4bf8-4941-ab67-c74ccfb4964e)

&emsp;&emsp;We can see that a bubble can barely handle the 26 lowercase letters of the alphabet.<BR>
&emsp;&emsp;Depending on text input, it's a matter of testing to check if it fits or not.

- To have multiple lines within the same bubble, `\n` can be used to define **newline**. Next line first word should be written directly after the function. (no space in between).

An input such as `Text: First line\nSecond line\nThird line\nForth line\nFifth line` would render as :

![N1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1c56649-e34f-449c-9812-c899d65a0ecf)

We note that we would be allowed to have a **maximum of 5 lines** to show properly on screen.<BR>
Of course, this will be dependent of the bubble placement and some lines can be displayed out of screen depending on `Y` value.
(`Y` must be set between 0 and 5 to be able to have 5 lines of text as well as the bubble's outline in its whole displayed)

![N2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9062bbbb-5d65-41c9-910d-e25c00ac0d15)

Same goes with too many lines. Only fully displayable lines shows. If we set the `Y` at its minimum value (0) and set the text on 6 lines with `Text: First line\nSecond line\nThird line\nForth line\nFifth line\nSixth Line`, 
we end up with this result :

![N3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e15854b3-aff0-4954-ad0f-2a3f74fa56c3)

> [!TIP]
> A maximum of 5 lines of text in a bubble using the `\n` function.<BR>
> A maximum of 20-30 characters (spaces included) on a line.
<BR>

### üî∏  Bubble tail positioning
The positioning of the tail (the bubble pointer) is set by those 2 functions and their applicable options :
- `AlignH: ` = **H**orizontal **Align**ment (Options = `Left`, `Center`, `Right`)
- `AlignV: ` = **V**ertical **Align**ment (Options = `Top`, `Center`, `Bottom`)

As a result we have 9 (3x3) possible placement of the tail : 

![Bubble_Tails_POS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb72d3d-a527-4f8d-b5bb-bc33d217209f)

We note that having both `AlignH` & `AlignV` set to `Center` results in hiding the tail.

The coded outline of the bubble is not dependent of the animation background and will remain black even on top of a black background, and as consequence will not be visible :

![Bubble_Tails_NEG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa5799df-bc04-4f27-9bff-afa4d19f5e52)

It then renders slightly more squared as the rounded-angles of the outline are not visible.

> [!TIP]
> Use `AlignH: Center` **+** `AlignV: Center` to have no bubble tail.
<BR>

### üî∏  Bubble coordinates & Tail positioning issues
Here comes the tricky part :<BR>
If you set a tail to be visible, in order to be correctly displayed on screen, its design ***in its whole*** must be set to fit on the screen. Otherwise, you will face some strange behaviours.

Tails are adding a 4 pixels design on the edge of the bubble they're placed on.

![TAIL_SIZE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11cd9ce3-a3be-48aa-8b05-54390accc0e0)

To allow a tailed-bubble to be displayed on screen without issue, bubble coordinates values must be set taking into account those additionnal 4 pixels.<BR>
> [!WARNING]
> Issue will occur if there are less than 4 pixels between the screen's **left** or **top** border and the tail.

As a pict is worth a thousand words, let's have an insight on how it behaves if we set a bubble in the upper-left corner with not enough space from the edges to have its tail properly displayed.<BR>
In the following tests, we will set different bubble coordinates so it lacks 1 single from the screen border to allow tail to be fully displayed.<BR>
Again we will test with both white (orange) and black backgrounds as it helps to understand what is drawn on screen.

![Bubble Tails_POS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0aae534-a37c-4f70-a027-0ea9ab890fd9)

It enlights that issues occur when there is not enough space on TOP and/or LEFT screen sides to display the tail, creating some *backdraft* tail that displays over the text.<BR>
We note that, apart for just displaying what fits the screen, there is no particular issue with BOTTOM or RIGHT sides of the screen.<BR>
We will also note that, despite there is no tail to be meant to be shown on middle screenshot (`AlignH` & `AlignV` both set to `Center`), it still create for some reason a single and unwanted pixel in the upper-left corner.

![Bubble Tails_NEG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02469597-30d5-4695-9698-f94061657ffb)

Black background allows to enlight that the tails themselves are correctly drawn and that the issue is only on their outlines.

Testing on a single-line bubble makes even more weird result üëÄ :

![Bubble Tails_singleline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2b8226e-304e-45e4-bf3f-cf58a4810448)

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to mention that those strange artifacts are just visual bugs and won't make Flipper to crash.<BR>
> One could decide to use those strange tail behaviours in some artistic way... 

> [!TIP]
> When ***bubble*** is a layer above the ***animation*** one, main screen ***status bar*** and ***icons/battery*** are on a layer above bubble's.<BR>
> ‚Æö It must must be taken into consideration to avoid having text partially covered by those.<BR><BR>
> Ensure safe bubble coordinated with tail's position accordingly.<BR>
> ‚Æö It's safer to set your bubble `X: ` & `Y: ` to at least `4` to ensure avoiding issue with tail.<BR>
> ‚Æö Try to set your tail position to the sides (or center) of the bubble that are furthest from the edge of the screen.
