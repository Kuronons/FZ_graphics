   - ___MOMENTUM___
      
      [<b>Momentum</b>](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware) Custom Firmware animations.<BR>
      Idea was to have a bunch of animations, all starting with the same passive frames but having different active ones.<BR>
      Design is based on rotating / spinning / rolling movements to recall the momentum concept.<BR>
      The "M" of Momentum ends up in negative & reversed at the end of active frames showing a "W", wink to Momentum's creator, [WillyJL](https://github.com/Willy-JL)
