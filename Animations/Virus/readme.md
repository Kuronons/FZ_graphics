Here are animations that takes their inspiration from old PC viruses :

   - ___CMOSDead___
      
      Inspired by the 1998's *<B>CMOSDead</b>* DOS virus. Passive frames are the command line in loop, pushing back will show the payload.
      
      Note : Thinking of making a second version that would respect a bit more the original payload display.
