Here are animations that takes their inspiration from old PC viruses :

   - ___CMOSDead___
      
      Inspired by the 1998's *<B>CMOSDead</b>* DOS virus.<BR>
      Passive frames are the command line in loop, pushing back will show the payload.
      
      Note : Thinking of making a second version that would respect a bit more the original payload display.

   - ___UPSILON___
      
      Inspired by the 2015 (?) *<B>UPSILON</b>* DOS virus by *int7bh* / [@OrangeShellGaming](https://www.youtube.com/user/OrangeShellGaming).<BR>
      Passive frames are the command line in loop, pushing back will show the payload.
      
      Note : Reworked the DOS prompt with adequate spaces between alphanums and interlines.<BR>
             The original payload was a submission to [*danooct1*](https://www.youtube.com/@danooct1) by one of his viewer. Creator is most probably finnish.<BR>
             The expression *<B>Suomi Perkele</b>* is a somehow respectful/chauvinistic idiomatic that can be translated as *Finnish Devil*.<BR>
             *<B>Upsilon</b>* can send a bunch of different payloads/attacks and contains a bunch of easter eggs.<BR>
             Due to the restrictive number of frames a Flip anim can handle, only one of the most visual is proposed here.<BR>
             The latin text, partially hidden by status bar, is the (shortened) lyrics of Final Fantasy VII's Sephiroth battle theme :<BR>
     <b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Estuans interius ira vehementi  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*Burning inside with violent anger*</b><BR>
     <b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sephiroth ! Sephiroth !  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;*Sephiroth ! Sephiroth !*</b><BR>
     <b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sors immanis, et inanis &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;*A cruel and empty fate*</b><BR>
     <b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Veni, veni, venias, ne me mori facias &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;*Come, come, oh come ! Don't let me die*</b><BR>
     <b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;GLORIOSA ! GENEROSA ! &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;*GLORIOUS ! GENEROUS !*</b><BR>
     <b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sephiroth ! Sephiroth !  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;*Sephiroth ! Sephiroth !*</b><BR>
             I added my own easter egg, replacing "Sephiroth" by "Sasquach" because... Voil√† quoi ! O_oV

      Inspired by the 1992 *<B>WALKER</b>* DOS virus by *UJHPTTLZ*.<BR>
      Passive frames are the command line in loop, pushing back will show the payload.
      
      Note : The old man sprites comes from the 1987 video game *Bad Street Brawler*.<BR>
             This original virus contains the following internal text string, providing some intel on its origins :<BR>
             "*WALKER V1.00 This absolutely harmless and self-destructive program is written by UJHPTTLZ in the city of Istanbul, 1992*"<BR>
             I made this anim on a suggestion from [7h30th3r0n3](https://github.com/7h30th3r0n3) ! Challenge accepted ! O_oV

I also added a [manifest.txt](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/SF_Corporations_Logos/manifest.txt) file with the 12 entries for a quick copy&paste. (butthurt & level set for RogueMaster FW, edit these if under another firmware)

You can download each anim as separate zip files or the [12 all together](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/SF_Corporations_Logos/Kuronons_SFlogo_Collection%20(12%20animations).zip).

Also you can download those directly as an [animation pack](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics/blob/main/Animations/SF_Corporations_Logos/Kuronons%20-%20Sci-Fi%20Corps.zip) to use with Momentum / Xtreme firmwares.
