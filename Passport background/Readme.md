Here you can find passport backgrounds originally designed for ***RogueMaster*** & ***SquachWare*** firmwares.<BR><BR>
I edited the passport.c file in RM so a <i><b>single 128x64px picture</b></i> is used instead of <i><b>left + bottom borders picts + coded lines/dots</b></i> as in ofw.<BR>
As well some pixel placement adjustments have been made... Note that depending on which fw I was on when I took screenshot, you'll see minor differences between passports previews (XP font size and position for instance).<BR><BR>
Note that those should work totally fine with ***Momentum***. They would also correctly display under ***Xtreme*** but bottom part would be partially covered with their *Tot* button.<BR>
I am adding a folder with those under .bmx file format so you can directly use them with those 2 firmwares without having to compile via python. You will still have to RENAME each file according to your fw requirements<BR><BR>
Note that those can't be used under Official or Unleashed firmwares UNLESS you edit the passport.c file's code accordingly and recompile the whole fw.<BR><BR>
