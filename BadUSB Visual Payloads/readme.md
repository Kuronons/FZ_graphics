- ___KURONONS FZ___ - Notepad visual payload (Windows)
  
  Proof of concept for fun (1200+ lines, super super fun... XD)<BR>
  Almost only using ALTCHAR / REPEAT inputs to display non ASCII characters.<BR>
  -> Takes ages to display ! o_o<BR>
  -> Would not recommand using that many ALTCHAR for such a result... Be wise and choose ASCII !! :D<BR>
  Made Aug. 9, 2022.<BR><BR>
  Updated Sep. 9, 2023 :
  > The use of *"STRING  "* for a space output was not working anymore<BR>
  > -> replaced by *"SPACE"*<BR>
  > Fixed *Flipper* last *R* to fit *zero* one
